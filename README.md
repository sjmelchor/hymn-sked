# hymn-sked

I play the piano for my church services every week, which I generally enjoy. However, the idea of needing to pick 3 songs for every Sunday of the year gets pretty daunting for my executive functioning, so instead, I spent waaaaay longer writing a cute, clunky little program to do it for me. 

This version ensures that topically appropriate songs are selected (for example, only choosing Christmas songs at Christmas time), and that the same song isn't repeated at the beginning and ending of the meeting. 

It does require the user to start with a manually-curated csv of songs (the curation is to assign topics & to weed out obscure songs/ones you hate), and still required a bit of manual cleanup at the end. It also requires an input calendar csv that lists the dates of each service + topics (if desired...again, this is mostly christmas/easter stuff).
